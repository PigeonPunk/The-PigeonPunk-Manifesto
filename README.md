## Overview
This document defines a pigeon-based internet system in a world without electronics. 

## Networking
- Pigeons carry packets of data, and are sent in batches to enable return communication.
- It is possible to carry messages over long distances using headers for routers, and changing pigeon at each point in the network.

### Packets
- Instead of punchcards, we can train pigeons to peck out holes in crackers. Each point in the traceroute would have a "packet header" pigeon to peck out the packet headers. To verify that a pigeon had travelled via a given point in the route, a hole would be pecked out to indicate that a destination *should* be reached, and another hole pecked out to indicate that a destination *has* been reached. 

- Diffie-Hellman key exchange can provide encryption to prevent MITM attacks (intercepting pigeons).
- Extra pigeons must be taped to each other since a pigeon can only fly home. The extra pigeons provides additional lift. A pigeon can only carry 10% of its bodyweight so additional pigeons are required to mitigate the Pigeon Lift Problem.
- Pigeon poop can be used to provide fertiliser for pigeon feed. Humanity would live underground to facilitate this. Thus a self-sustaining pigeon feeding system can be established.
- Pigeons must travel in symmetric patterns to make sure that lift is evenly distributed. If only one pigeon controls direction (i.e covering the eyes of the lift pigeons), it is possible to change destination very easily.

## Server
- A mouse or rat carries the necessary cracker to move it around the server.

## Security Concerns
- A maliciously trained pigeon could cause an NTP DDOS attack by spoofing home.

## Blockchain
- Whales can broadcast blockchain state transitions to the entire network. Whales solve the problem of long term communication by aqueduct on land and ocean by water.
- Whales could use morse code to allow interspecies communication between various animals used in the Pigeon Protocol.
## Computation
Monkeys would operate punchcard computers.
