## Networking
- Pigeons carry packets, and are trained to go between the client and the server. 
- It is possible to carry messages over long distances using headers for routers, and changing pigeon at each point in the network.
- Instead of punchcards, we can train pigeons to peck out holes in crackers.
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange can provide encryption to prevent MITM attacks.
- Extra pigeons must be taped to each other since a pigeon can only fly home. The extra pigeons provides additional lift.
- Pigeon poop can be used to provide fertiliser for pigeon feed. Humanity would live underground to facilitate this.

## Server
- A mouse or rat carries the necessary cracker to move it around the server.

## Security Concerns
- A maliciously trained pigeon could cause an NTP DDOS attack by spoofing home.

## Blockchain
- Whales can broadcast blockchain state transitions to the entire network. Whales solve the problem of long term communication by aqueduct on land and ocean by water.

## Computation
Monkeys would operate punchcard computers.
